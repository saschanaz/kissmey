# Kissmey

A side project to progressively port Misskey's backend core to Rust, ultimately to be a standalone subset of the original one.

No new feature will be born here, see [Misskey](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey) for fun things.

## Plan

* Get JSON from Fastify and pass it to Rust backend
* Add Jest/E2E tests to the original Misskey repository and sync back here to keep being compatible
	* But write unit tests in Rust
